Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
The line "s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)" is the constraint of TCP.

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
The client socket is using "socket.connect((remoteIp, port))", the server socket is using "s.bind(Host, port)" instead.

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
in 'echo_server.py' the line "s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)" is doing the job.

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
"Connected by (127.0.0.1, port number)" is printed

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
the message we sent to the server
